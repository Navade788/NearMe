The temple's main deity is Lord Murugan, who is worshipped as the god of war and is depicted as a handsome young man riding a peacock with six faces and twelve arms. The idol is adorned with rich gold and diamonds. The temple architecture is a fine example of the Dravidian style, with a tall gopuram (gateway tower) at the entrance, adorned with intricate carvings. The temple has a mandapam (hall) with beautifully carved pillars, which houses the main shrine.
